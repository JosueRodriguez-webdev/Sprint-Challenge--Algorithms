#### Please add your answers to the **_Analysis of Algorithms_** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) n^3 - this one is tough because even though I physically see the n^3 I want to immediately say its n^3 but I tried it with random numbers and it doesn't take long to break the loop. I'm going with my first guess.

b) n^2 - while loop inside the for loop and using range to count towards the n.

c) n - recursive is similar to a for loop so and we wont return until it hits 0.

## Exercise II

Damn this one is tough as well, uhhhhhh...

I would ask questions first,

Are we assuming f is not passed as a parameter in the function?
Do we hard code / is there some type of percentage base on floors we should calculate to determine the eggs breaking floor?
How do we determine the eggs breaking point?

I would require user to pass in array of floors as n.
I would also require a formula to calculate the when the eggs begin to break in the function

Assuming the formula that calculates the by the length of an array then i would do an if statement and return the value of f.

O(1)
